It's been an awesome time working with you, and building out 2 new features (chat and admin tool). Amazing what you did in just 6 weeks! Thanks also for all the great feedback. You definitely challenged and pushed the tech stack in a different direction. I hope while you enjoy your lonely cereal dinners, you will think of me and what all the chat bugs youâ€™ve left for me. I think youâ€™ve been scheming revenge on how to get back at me for all the bugs I left for you at PointsTravel ðŸ˜‰  Until we meet again! "

Itâ€™s a shame we couldnâ€™t make it happen this time around, but I know where to find you. Expect another email/call in the futureâ€¦ (not foreboding sort of ellipsis but a good type of ellipsis) "

I remember just not long ago having our first one on one and then seeing how hard of a worker you are, especially with building the Admin tool from scratch and how much attention you paid to detail. Thank you for helping me to improve my code as well with commenting on my PRs and challenging me to think critically about some of my code. It was great to have you here, even if for a short period of time, and I wish you the best of luck with your next position (and hope our paths cross again)!"

Was great watching it get smashed out like that and I enjoyed working with you and watching the backend parts we put together come to life attached to a front end system. Would be great if you could come back to transcarent again but I understand sometimes life brings us to other opportunities! I wish you the best and hope you will continue to build awesome applications for your next adventure"
